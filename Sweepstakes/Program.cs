//(5 points)X As a developer, I want consistent commits and descriptive commit messages.
//(5 points)X As a developer, I want to create a Contestant class that has a first name, last name, email address, and registration number.
//(10 points)X As a developer, I want to create a user interface for any information the application would need to get from the user.One example would be the functionality to assign a Contestant object a first name, last name, email address, and registration number.
//(15 points)X As a developer, I want to create a Sweepstakes class that uses the Dictionary data structure as an underlying structure.The Sweepstakes class will have the following methods with full implementation(write the functionality) of each method:
//      -	Sweepstakes(string name)
//      -	void RegisterContestant(Contestant contestant)
//      -	string PickWinner()
//      -	void PrintContestantInfo(Contestant contestant)
//(10 points)X As a developer, I want to write an ISweepstakesManager interface with the following methods for a sweepstakes management system:
//      -	void InsertSweepstakes(Sweepstakes sweepstakes)
//      -	Sweepstakes GetSweepstakes()
//      -   As a developer, I needed to add a Count property of the Queue/Stack counts so that I can quickly know how many sweepstakes there are.
//(10 points)X As a developer, I want to create a SweepstakesStackManager class that uses the Stack data structure as an underlying structure.
//(10 points)X As a developer, I want to create a SweepstakesQueueManager class that uses the Queue data structure as an underlying structure.
//(10 points)X As a developer, I want my SweepstakesStackManager class and SweepstakesQueueManager class to inherit from the ISweepstakesManager interface and implement the methods from the ISweepstakesManager interface using Stack and Queue methods.
//(5 points)X As a developer, I want to create a MarketingFirm class. 
//(10 points)X As a developer, I want to implement dependency injection in my MarketingFirm class so that I can utilize a sweepstakes manager.
//(10 points)X As a developer, I want to use the factory design pattern to allow a user to choose between a SweepstakesStackManager or a SweepstakesQueueManager to manage the sweepstakes objects.

//Bonus Points:
//(5 points)?MAYBE? As a developer, I want to use the observer design pattern to notify all users of the winning contestant, with the winner of the sweepstakes getting a different message specifically congratulating them on being the winner.
//(5 points) As a developer, I want to send an actual email to a sweepstakes winner using an MailKit API https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit
